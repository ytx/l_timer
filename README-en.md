# Timer for Lecture

A timer application designed to manage lecture sessions and breaks during training programs.
When you're focused on lecturing, it's easy to forget about breaks, so this app notifies you with sound to encourage appropriate rest periods.
I created this after receiving feedback in post-lecture surveys about insufficient breaks.
After implementation, survey results improved for both in-person and online training sessions.

You can launch it directly from https://xpenguin.biz/l_timer/
All data is stored in the browser's LocalStorage and never sent to a server, so you can use it with confidence.

All code is written by Claude Code. I barely reviewed the implementation.
I'm building what I need, and have tested it on Chrome for Windows/macOS only.
While I'm not planning to make it overly feature-rich, I'm open to considering feature requests.
The content below was automatically written by Claude Code and might sound a bit exaggerated, but it's mostly accurate.
